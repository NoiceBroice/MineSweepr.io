# MineSweepr.io
Java applet draft for a website I hope to make for average minesweeper enjoyers.

I plan to keep this project very portable and only require the Double-click executable jar in releases

It's possible it could take some sort of a chess.com & tetr.io inspiration as I like the style and competition made out of tetris
