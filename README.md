# MineSweepr.io
java applet draft for a websiite I hope to make for average minesweeper enjoyers.
it's possible it could take some sort of a chess.com & tetr.io inspiration as I like:
-how clean they are
-the competition involved
-coding is fun and I can't wait to have more fun
Ranking will hopefully happen

and servers and running a website will be a difficult joy to come can't wait to go through pain and suffering
