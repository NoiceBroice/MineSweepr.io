# MineSweepr.io
java applet draft for a website I hope to make for average minesweeper enjoyers.
it's possible it could take some sort of a chess.com & tetr.io inspiration as I like:

- how clean they are

- the competition involved

- yeah

Ranking will hopefully happen

and servers and running a website will be a difficult joy to come can't wait to go through pain and suffering
