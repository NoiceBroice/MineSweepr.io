# MineSweepr.io
Java applet draft for a website I hope to make for average minesweeper enjoyers.

I plan to keep this project very portable and only require the executable jar

it's possible it could take some sort of a chess.com & tetr.io inspiration as I like:

- how clean they are

- the competition involved
